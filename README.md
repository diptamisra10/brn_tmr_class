EfficientNet is a family of convolutional neural network (CNN) models designed for image classification tasks. It is known for its efficiency and high performance, achieved by uniformly scaling depth, width, and resolution using a compound scaling method.

Key Features of EfficientNet:
Compound Scaling:

EfficientNet scales the model's depth, width, and resolution systematically to achieve better accuracy and efficiency.
Base Architecture (EfficientNet-B0):

EfficientNet-B0 is the baseline model. It uses the Mobile Inverted Bottleneck Convolution (MBConv) blocks with squeeze-and-excitation optimization.
Model Variants:

Models range from EfficientNet-B0 (smallest) to EfficientNet-B7 (largest). Larger variants have more parameters and computational requirements but achieve higher accuracy.
Lightweight and Accurate:

EfficientNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with significantly fewer parameters and FLOPs compared to other CNN architectures like ResNet or Inception.
